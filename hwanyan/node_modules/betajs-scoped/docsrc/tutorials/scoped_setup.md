The Scoped system needs to be loaded once in the beginning. It has no dependencies itself.

It can be either loaded directly by including Scoped:
```
   <script src="//cdn.rawgit.com/betajs/betajs-scoped/master/dist/scoped.min.js"></script>
```

Or you can compile it into one of your libraries.

You can even include it more than once without any issues.
